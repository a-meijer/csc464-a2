Problem 2 Description.

The OM(m) algorithm for the Byzantine Generals Problem involves having all of
the generals broadcast messages to one another. I decided to use Golang for this because
channels allow for easy communication between threads.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find a way to build new channels according to a user input.
So for this problem, I have implemented a solution just with 3 generals, where 1 general is traitorous.
To test my solution, I ran it with both RETREAT and ATTACK commands.
UPDATE Nov. 22:
I couldn't find a way to have the generals operate concurrently, both receiving and sending messages without deadlock.
Hence, I have no solution.
