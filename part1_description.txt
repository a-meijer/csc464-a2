Problem 1 Description.
This file contains a short description of the implementation for vector clocks.
I decided to use Golang for my solution because of the easy-to-use built-in
channels for concurrent threads. 

I referred to the internet article at this URL for guidance:
https://medium.com/@balrajasubbiah/lamport-clocks-and-vector-clocks-b713db1890d7

To demonstrate the implementation of Vector Clocks, I will have three threads
with vector clocks that interact concurrently. The threads will print out Vector
Timestamps according to the example from the URL I mentioned. The same example
is also shown on the Wikipedia page for Vector Clocks. I have also included an
image of the example in the Github repository titled vector_clocks_example.png
